# why make a programming language?

---

# what's even the point

- tbh your language wont take off (most likely) but its worth it to learn how our tools work
- im a semi self taught programmer and didnt take a compiler class 
- its fun and a flex
- practice should be harder than the game

---

# how do you even do this

- there are two main routes: interpreter and compiler
- while a lot of things overlap generally: 
    - interpreters execute the code now 
    - compilers translate the code to another language to be executed later
- interpreters are typicallay slower but easier to build
- i'd recommend starting with an interpreter and then converting it to a compiler later

# anatomy of a programming language

- the scanner/lexer translates source code (typically a string of characters) to a list of `tokens`
- a token is anything that has significance to our language (a number, a string, an operator, an identifier)
- the parser takes those tokens and creates a stucture to represent our program, commonly a tree
- this is where interpreters and compilers diverge

---

# interpreter

- from here an interpreter will evaluate the code by walking the tree generated by the parser
- and honestly after that you can say you have built a programming language but...

---

# compiler

- at this point the compiler would also walk the tree but many things can happer from there
- it could just generate machine code or assembly
- it could generate IR (intermediate representation) that it can pass to another program to execute
    - and example for be LLVM IR or and IR you make up
- it could generate bytecode to run on a custom virtual machine that you also build
- it could also add a step to optimize the code (removing dead code, inlining function calls, etc)
- and a million other things could happen that i dont even know about

# lets make a tiny language

```
var string = "hell yah"
var num1 = 1
var num2 = 2
var num3 = num1 + num2

func add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2
}

if num3 == add(num1, num2) {
    print("true")
}
 
```

# oh and we're gonna make an interpreter and a compiler

- LFG!!!!!
- oh also we're doing it in rust
